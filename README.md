# RS_-_MS_Kenya
I created and ran two machine learning techniques for a farming region near the town of Kilala, a major maize growing region in Kenya. Here I used QGIS to create training input data and validation data and then used R Studio to run the SVM and RF machine learning models and to calculate the results based on the validation dataset.
